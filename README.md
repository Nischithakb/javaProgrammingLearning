<h2>Day 1: String Reverse Program</h2>
<p>This Java program is a simple implementation to reverse a string entered by the user.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The program prompts the user to enter a string input.</li>
  <li>It reads the input string using a Scanner.</li>
  <li>It then iterates through each character of the input string in reverse order and constructs a new string, effectively reversing the input string.</li>
  <li>Finally, it prints the reversed string.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
  <li>User Input: The program demonstrates how to accept user input in Java using the Scanner class.</li>
  <li>String Reversal: It illustrates a basic algorithm to reverse a string by iterating through its characters from the end to the beginning.</li>
  <li>String Concatenation: The reversed string is constructed by appending characters one by one</li>
  <li>Resource Management: The Scanner object is closed after reading the input to release system resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Day 2: String Palindrome Program</h2>
<p>This Java program checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The program prompts the user to enter a string input.</li>
  <li>It reads the input string using a Scanner.</li>
  <li>It converts the input string to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparison.</li>
  <li>It then iterates through each character of the input string in reverse order and constructs a new string, effectively reversing the input string.</li>
  <li>It compares the reversed string with the original string to determine if they are equal.</li>
  <li>Finally, it prints whether the input string is a palindrome or not.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
  <li>User Input: this program demonstrates how to accept user input in Java using the Scanner class.</li>
  <li>String Reversal: It illustrates a basic algorithm to reverse a string by iterating through its characters from the end to the beginning.</li>
  <li>Palindrome Checking: After reversing the string, it compares the reversed string with the original string to determine if they are equal. If they are equal, the input string is considered a palindrome; otherwise, it's not.</li>
  <li>Case Insensitivity: The program converts the input string to lowercase before comparison to ensure case-insensitive palindrome checking.</li>
  <li>Resource Management: The Scanner object is closed after reading the input to release system resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Day 3: Number Palindrome Program</h2>
<p>This Java program checks whether a given integer is a palindrome or not.</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The program prompts the user to enter an integer input.</li>
  <li>It reads the input number using a Scanner.</li>
  <li>It converts the input number to a string to facilitate palindrome checking.</li>
  <li>It then iterates through each digit of the input number in reverse order and constructs a new string, effectively reversing the input number.</li>
  <li>It compares the reversed string with the original string to determine if they are equal.</li>
  <li>Finally, it prints whether the input number is a palindrome or not.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
  <li>User Input: this program demonstrates how to accept user input in Java using the Scanner class.</li>
  <li>String Conversion: Unlike the previous programs that dealt with string inputs directly, this program converts the integer input to a string for palindrome checking.</li>
  <li>String Reversal: It illustrates a basic algorithm to reverse a string by iterating through its characters from the end to the beginning.</li>
  <li>Palindrome Checking: After reversing the string, it compares the reversed string with the original string to determine if they are equal. If they are equal, the input string is considered a palindrome; otherwise, it's not.</li>
  <li>Resource Management: The Scanner object is closed after reading the input to release system resources.</li>
</ul>
